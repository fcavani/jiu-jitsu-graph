Jiu-jitsu positions, sequences, scores and descriptions graph database.

It's a simple way to view and understand some aspects of a complex art by someone with a blue belt. I'm really don't want to simplify Jiu-jitsu to some computational model, it's not possible, but it's fun to document it.

**This isn't a form of replacement to the normal train in a properly school with a good master.**

## dgraph

I'm migrating from neo4j to dgraph (simple licensing, fast, easy to use and good query language). Then I will need a new model, a better one to describe the data. Expect a lot of changes before I reach a stable model and start to fill in the data from the old model to here.
